This projecct is for client in healthcare business. I have to build a screening test for diabetes for a chain of hospitals located in New York. This test will be done for patients coming in the hospital to provide a quick test of whether they have diabetes or not before results of proper medical testing can be done.
This will serve as initial screening and help the doctors in giving initial medication to the identified patients.
